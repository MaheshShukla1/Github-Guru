# 🔄 05 – Collaboration & Pull Requests

Welcome to the **collaboration zone** 🤝 — where developers unite, contribute, and build amazing things *together*.  

If Git helps you **track your own code**, GitHub helps you **collaborate on everyone’s code** 🌍.  
Let’s go step-by-step from **forking** a repo to **merging pull requests** — just like pros in open source projects. 💪  

---

## 🍴 1. Fork a Repository

A **fork** is your personal copy of someone else’s repo on GitHub.

Think of it like cloning your friend’s notes to add your own highlights. 📝  

### 🪄 Step-by-Step:

1. Go to the repository you want to contribute to.  
2. Click the **Fork** button (top-right).  
3. Choose your profile — GitHub creates a personal copy.  
4. You can now experiment freely without affecting the original repo.

💡 **Pro Tip:**  
Forking is essential for **open-source contributions** — it keeps your changes isolated and reviewable.

---

## 🌿 2. Create a Feature Branch

Before you start coding, create a **branch** to organize your changes.  
Each branch should represent one feature or bug fix.  

### ⚙️ Commands:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-login-page
```


This creates a new branch called `feature/add-login-page` and switches to it.

💡 **Branch Naming Convention:**

|Type|Example|
|---|---|
|Feature|`feature/add-dark-mode`|
|Fix|`fix/navbar-alignment`|
|Docs|`docs/update-readme`|
|Chore|`chore/dependency-updates`|

✅ Keeps your repo clean and understandable for teams.

---

## ✍️ 3. Make Changes & Commit

Now, modify your code or documentation.

Once done:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add login page with responsive layout"
```

💡 **Commit Tips:**

- Use **present tense** (“Add feature”, not “Added feature”)
    
- Keep messages short but meaningful
    
- Reference issue numbers if applicable (e.g., `#42`)
    

🧠 Example:

> "Fix: resolve login API error on mobile (#42)"

---

## 🚀 4. Push to Remote Branch

Once your commits are ready, push them to your **forked repository**:

```bash
git push origin feature/add-login-page
```

This uploads your feature branch to GitHub.

💡 If it’s your first push:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/add-login-page
```

Now, head to GitHub — you’ll see a prompt like:

> “Compare & pull request”

That’s your next step 👇

---

## 🧩 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)

A **Pull Request (PR)** is how you propose changes to a project.  
You’re basically saying, “Hey, I made some improvements — please review and merge!”

### 🪄 Steps:

1. Go to your forked repo on GitHub
    
2. Click **Compare & pull request**
    
3. Add:
    
    - A clear title: `Add responsive login page`
        
    - A short description of changes
        
4. Choose:
    
    - **Base Repository:** The original project
        
    - **Base Branch:** Usually `main` or `dev`
        
    - **Head Branch:** Your feature branch
        
5. Click **Create Pull Request** ✅
    

🎯 Example PR title:

> “✨ Add responsive login feature (mobile support)”

---

## 👀 6. Review & Merge PR

Once submitted, maintainers or teammates will review your PR.

### 💬 PR Review Process:

- 🧩 Code feedback & suggestions
    
- 🧪 Automated checks (CI/CD, tests)
    
- 🧠 Discussions or design notes
    

When approved:

- Maintainer clicks **Merge Pull Request**
    
- Changes become part of the main branch 🎉
    

### ⚙️ After Merge:

Sync your local main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## 💖 7. Contributing Guidelines for Open Source

Every big open-source repo has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that explains how to contribute effectively.

Here’s what you should include in yours 👇

### 🧰 Example Structure:

```markdown
# Contributing Guidelines

1. Fork the repository 🍴
2. Clone your fork:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
3. Create a feature branch:
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
4. Commit your changes:
   git commit -m "Add your awesome feature"
5. Push to your fork:
   git push origin feature/your-feature
6. Submit a Pull Request 🎉
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Add labels for first-time contributors like:

- `good first issue`
    
- `help wanted`
    

They attract newcomers and boost engagement 💬

## ⚡ Real-World Example: Team Workflow

Here’s how a **team project** works in GitHub:

```bash
# Developer 1 creates feature
git checkout -b feature/add-payment

# Developer 2 fixes a bug
git checkout -b fix/api-timeout

# Both push their changes
git push origin feature/add-payment
git push origin fix/api-timeout

# Review & merge PRs into main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Now everyone stays synced — teamwork done right ✅

---

## 🧠 Brain Hack — Think of PRs Like “Code Conversations”

- A **commit** is you talking to yourself 🗣️
    
- A **PR** is you talking to your team 💬
    
- A **merge** is your idea becoming part of the project 🚀

## 💡 Best Practices for Collaboration

|Habit|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|Create branches per feature|Keeps history clean|
|Write meaningful commits|Easier reviews|
|Sync (`pull`) before pushing|Avoid conflicts|
|Respect code reviews|Builds trust|
|Use PR templates|Saves time for maintainers|

---

## 🪄 Bonus: Creating a Pull Request Template

To standardize PRs, create a file:

```bash
.github/pull_request_template.md
```

### Example:

```markdown
## 🧩 Description
Briefly describe the changes and motivation.

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] Code tested
- [ ] Linting passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 💬 Related Issues
Closes #issue_number
```

This ensures **clean, consistent PRs** for every contributor 🧹

## 🎯 Quick Recap

✅ You forked and cloned repos  
✅ You created branches for features  
✅ You pushed commits and opened PRs  
✅ You learned how reviews and merges work  
✅ You understood open-source contribution flow
